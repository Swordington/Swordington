### Heyo 🙃

I'm Quinn, a Software Engineer and Systems Administrator from the midwest USA. (The reason your SLA can't be 100%)

 - 🛠️ I build a lot of small and random things, many of which are APIs, most of which are just for fun.
 - 🏢 I'm currently the Lead Director [**@thebigbrothergroup**](https://github.com/thebigbrothergroup), and a Network Lead & Co-Owner [**@IrisMCDEV**](https://github.com/IrisMCDEV)
 - 📧 To get in touch, shoot me an email or a message on Twitter! (You can find these in the sidebar of my profile :)
