### Heyo 🙃

I'm Quinn, a Software Engineer and Systems Administrator from the midwest USA.

 - 🛠️ I build a lot of small and random things, many of which are APIs, most of which are just for fun.
   - 💖 Some of my favorite projects include the [hug API](https://github.com/the1sword/hug-api), and the very random [42-api](https://github.com/the1sword/42-api)
 - 🏢 I'm currently the Lead Director [**@thebigbrothergroup**](https://github.com/thebigbrothergroup), a Network Lead & Co-Owner [**@IrisMCDEV**](https://github.com/IrisMCDEV), and the Engineering Lead [**@CubicoMC**](https://github.com/CubicoMC)
